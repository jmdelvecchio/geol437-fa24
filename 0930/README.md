# Week 5 instructions

## Run `git pull` to update the class repo with the latest assignments
1. On the JupyterHub, navigate to the Terminal and use `cd geol437-fa24` to enter that directory
2. Run `git pull` to <i>pull</i> updates from the remote repo to your local repo 
3. Do this every week to ensure your files are up to date for the class. 

## Examine the two notebooks in the `0930` directory
*(Time: approx 2 hours)*


I <b>expect</b> you to complete `iterating.ipynb` before our class meeting on the 16th, and I bet it won't take more than 2 hours. I <b>strongly encourage</b> you to look through `poroducing_soil.ipynb` before class, but we will work together on the assignment.
