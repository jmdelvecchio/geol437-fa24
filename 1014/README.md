# Structure-from-motion photogrammetry

This week we're taking a break from coding and building some 3D models. Computers and cameras have gotten so great in the past decade that even our phones can do on-the-fly structure-from-motion photogrammetry! I am borrowing heavily from material developed by Kate Shervais (UNAVCO), Bruce Douglas (Indiana University), and Chris Crosby (EarthScope) as featured on the [SERC website](https://serc.carleton.edu/getsi/teaching_materials/high-rez-topo/unit1-sfm.html).

## Background reading
Review one of the following bullet points:
 - View the [research application presentation](https://cdn.serc.carleton.edu/files/getsi/teaching_materials/high-rez-topo/sfm_research_applications.v4.pptx) and view the [SfM workflow presentation](https://cdn.serc.carleton.edu/files/getsi/teaching_materials/high-rez-topo/sfm_workflow.v6.pptx)
OR
 - The [SfM field manual for students](https://cdn.serc.carleton.edu/files/getsi/teaching_materials/high-rez-topo/sfm_field_methods_manual.v4.pdf) is similar to the above resources, but presented in a guide form. 

Review the [Agisoft MetaShape Quick Guide](https://cdn.serc.carleton.edu/files/NAGTWorkshops/online_field/activities/day1_quickguide_metashape.v4.docx) before embarking on any photo taking or survey design. 
- Once you have performed a survey, you can consult the [in-depth guide](https://cdn.serc.carleton.edu/files/getsi/teaching_materials/high-rez-topo/sfm_data_processing_exploration_2023.docx)

All this landscape-scale modeling getting you down? Watch a video for applications to [paleontology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5LDI4g6ROk), or examine [3D outcrops](https://sketchfab.com/juliacarr) constructed by my labmate Julia Carr and used for virtual outcrop observations during COVID! 


<i>For extra fun you can watch [a series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLUGTmOp4eo&list=PLYqCeHIaz7Pi2jpqsROsk064vmOsMPz9v) including in the first video a shoutout from my REU advisor to our failure of a field season when all this drone-based photogrammetry was new! See how far I've come :')</i>

## Collecting a dataset
I would like you to come to class on the 14th with either (1) an idea of a photo spot and a sketched out survey plan , OR (2) a collection of photos with <b>proper scale bars</b>, control points, and photo angles/overlap as described in the guides above. My one request is to please <b>not overdo it</b> with the photos - if we're all going to share the computer to make models we have to keep them computationally small, so I'm thinking <20 photos. You can always take a lot of photos and only use a few in a model. Humor me, start small and then see how long it'll take to process. 

I have a DSLR camera I can loan out to folks if you get in touch early. I have a few ground control points that MetaShape [automatically registers](https://agisoft.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/31000148855-coded-targets-and-scale-bars) if they are in your scene. Come see me if you'd like to use them. 

## Sign up on the Big Rig
Use this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18KBCMOBPjofLzehpWsv7dRMf1CfqXrRf_CAyKp2JzCg/edit?usp=sharing) to sign up for a time to use the Big Rig - think an hour at a time, and pray that it only takes you that long to build your model. Otherwise, you'll need to come back, and right now there are only so many people with key/swipe access to Room 109 to let you in especially after hours. Talk to Trina if you'd like to get swipe access for after hours work. 

## Register for a SketchFab account
You'll upload your models here. 

# Deliverable
Submit the URL of one uploaded geological* 3D model to SketchFab with <b>three</b> [annotations](https://sketchfab.com/blogs/community/want-your-models-to-tell-a-story-meet-our-new-annotations-feature/) that would be interesting to share with the public or an Intro class. See Julia Carr's 3D outcrop models for inspiration here. Your model <b>must feature a scale bar</b> of some kind, and a north arrow if applicable. Some ideas:
- fossils
- 

(*)I'm going to be somewhat liberal with this interpretation, don't make me regret that.
