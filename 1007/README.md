# Week 6 instructions

## Run `git pull` to update the class repo with the latest assignments
1. On the JupyterHub, navigate to the Terminal and use `cd geol437-fa24` to enter that directory
2. Run `git pull` to <i>pull</i> updates from the remote repo to your local repo 
3. Do this every week to ensure your files are up to date for the class. 

## Read online textbook
You <b>must</b> read [Chapter 5](https://pythongis.org/part2/chapter-05/index.html) and [Chapter 6](https://pythongis.org/part2/chapter-06/index.html). Optional reading is [Chapter 7](https://pythongis.org/part2/chapter-07/index.html) and [Chapter 8](https://pythongis.org/part2/chapter-08/index.html).

## Examine the two notebooks in the `1007` directory
*(Time: approx 2 hours)*


I <b>expect</b> you to complete `vector_raster.ipynb` before our class meeting on the 7th, and I bet it won't take more than 2 hours. I <b>strongly encourage</b> you to look through `spatial_operations.ipynb` before class, but we will work together on the assignment.
