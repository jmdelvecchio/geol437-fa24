    "It's fall of 2014. Joanmarie has just declared a Geology major even though she is a senior, so she's in Mineralogy, Structural Geology, and Physical Volcanology, the latter of which is being taught as a series of computer-based labs in [COMSOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMSOL_Multiphysics). She is trying to get a modeled dike to intrude into some rock or something and is struggling at midnight in the computer lab. She hates computers, she hates modeling. Never will she touch a computer ever again to complete a geologic task. "

    "Your task: adapt the example FTCS problem to approximate the conditions at the Atla Stock at the time of emplacement (I'm looking at Figure 3 in Cook and Bowman 1994). You will need to change the units and dimensions of the problem to represent the physical system. Think about the following aspects:\n",
    "- What kind of thermal conditions existed in the system prior to emplacement? What is a good thermal conductivity?\n",
    "- What are the boundary conditions for a system like this? How big is your model and what boundaries are you setting?\n",
    "- What role does time play in this problem? What are your time units, what is a useful timestep, and how long will it take the system to fit the temperature profile implied by the data? "
