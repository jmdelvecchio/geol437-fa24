    "## What is Python?\n",
    "[Python](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html) is a programming language, which helps you deliver commands to a computer (and Ptyhon is a \"high-level\" language, which means that it looks more like human language instead of computer `beeps` and `boops`, which is good for us scientists). Python is a very popular language for many use cases and fields, and over the past decade it has been increasingly adopted by research scientists who write packages (more on that soon) to do their work (R is another language that scientists also like to use, but its packages have historically focused on statistics). It is also free to download and use, which is great and in contrast to Matlab, which is perhaps the other language that geoscientists may have encountered. It is indeed named after Monty Python's Flying Circus. "

If cells are not executed in order, the variable state might be different from what you expect, leading to errors or unexpected behavior.
